**Pople** is a toolkit written in Python to perform _ab initio_ thermochemistry calculations. The present version [Pople v21.4](https://github.com/moldis-group/Pople) supports G4(MP2) calculations using the [ORCA quantum chemistry program package](https://www.faccts.de/orca/) for all the electronic structure calculations. Pople enables customizing every step in a G4(MP2) calculation, facilitating the user to explore effects of level of theories and basis sets on the speed and accuracy. G4(MP2)-XP is a variant based on DLPNO-CCSD(T),RI-MP2, RI-DFT and RI-HF approximations permitting thermochemistry calculations of molecules as large as buckminsterfullerene.
